        <p>I’m a filmmaker, photographer, and programmer with a love for visually striking, emotionally rich storytelling. Whether curating films, capturing moments, or crafting narratives, I focus on the details that make something feel personal and alive. My work is shaped by an appreciation for subtle humor, absurdity, and the in-between moments that reveal something true.

Currently based in New York, I’ve programmed for film festivals, shot behind-the-scenes photography for productions, and worked across various creative roles that bridge my passion for cinema and visual art.</p>
